# 🧠 BrainRot Dating 💘

Welcome to **BrainRot Dating** — a swipe-based dating app that matches people based on how terminally online they are. Instead of asking about your hobbies or favorite foods, we ask the important questions:  
**Do you know who Skibidi Toilet is? Can you identify the "uueeeeiiiaaa cat"?**

## 🔍 What is this?

This is the **MVP (minimum viable product)** of a dating app for meme enjoyers. Users complete a meme fluency quiz, get categorized by their level of internet brain rot, and (eventually) swipe through potential matches with shared meme literacy.

This version is a **web-based prototype** hosted with GitHub Pages. A mobile app will follow once the core experience is validated.
